# braille-iant
Braille printers cost upwards of $6000, an almost ridiculous price point for something as common as a printer. However, this is the harsh reality for millions of people who are visually impaired. Much of the technology that aids these people is extremely expensive, which also discourages businesses and institutions to implement these technologies to cater to their less-abled clients. We wanted to tackle this issue at TOHacks 2021.

This is why we built Braille-iant, an effective and cost-efficient braille printer, costing less than 15$.

Braille-iant opens the doors for accessibility and inclusivity for the blind, having so many applications. Being low cost, it will be possible for blind customers to have physical copies of receipts, doctors notes, insurance policies, and much more. Good customer service is ACCESSIBLE customer service - and although we live in a virtually focused world, physical copies are still a necessity for important documents. As such, customer satisfaction is improved as Braille-iant makes every customer interaction a more inclusive one.
